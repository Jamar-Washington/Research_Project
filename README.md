# University_Research_Project

## Overview
This project is to recreate my research project from Angelo State University.

## Summary of research project
The project was based around high school football which is the biggest hobby I have. Growing up in Texas, Friday Night Lights is very serious and once I first saw it as a kid, I was instantly hooked. For the project, I was trying to figure out which team had the best odds of winning their respective district was. Even though I was not very successful in that aspect, I did come up with the finding the total number of possibilities and unique outcomes that are possible with a certain number of teams. I plan on recreating that portion of the project. When coming up with the unique number of outcomes, that is based on if every team was equally likely to beat each other. This is easy as my math professor and I were to not only program the right probability, but logically using a tournament graphes to visualize. I was able to present my findings at the Mathematical Association of America in Denton, Texas and at the Spring 2022 Angelo State Undergraduate and Graduate Research Symposium in San Angelo, Texas.

## Plans of project
* Recreate the python code to determine the number of unique outcomes that are possible with a certain number of teams
* Make the code more efficent as 8 or more teams made the program take more than a minute to compute
* Use the recreated code to see what would be effected if teams had uneven weights associated to them (more likely to beat other teams head to head)
* Potentially use machine learning to predict real life scenarios and compare to actual outcome (new project after this one is complete)

## Mathematical logic behind the project
Will be explained in a later update
